### **Basic SQL Questions**

1. **What is SQL?**  
   - **Answer**: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

2. **What is a primary key?**  
   - **Answer**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It cannot contain NULL values.

3. **What is the difference between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE`?**  
   - **Answer**: `DELETE` removes specific rows and can be rolled back. `TRUNCATE` removes all rows and resets the table, which cannot be rolled back.

4. **What is a foreign key?**  
   - **Answer**: A foreign key is a column that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between two tables.

5. **What is the `SELECT` statement used for?**  
   - **Answer**: The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database.

6. **What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?**  
   - **Answer**: `WHERE` filters rows before grouping, while `HAVING` filters groups after `GROUP BY`.

7. **What is a join in SQL?**  
   - **Answer**: A join combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

8. **What are the types of joins in SQL?**  
   - **Answer**: Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Join, and Cross Join.

9. **What is the `ORDER BY` clause used for?**  
   - **Answer**: `ORDER BY` sorts the result set in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

10. **What is the difference between `CHAR` and `VARCHAR`?**  
    - **Answer**: `CHAR` is fixed-length, while `VARCHAR` is variable-length.

11. **What is a subquery?**  
    - **Answer**: A subquery is a query nested inside another query, used to return data for the main query.

12. **What is the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`?**  
    - **Answer**: `INNER JOIN` returns only matching rows, while `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

13. **What is a view in SQL?**  
    - **Answer**: A view is a virtual table created by a query. It does not store data but displays data from one or more tables.

14. **What is normalization?**  
    - **Answer**: Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

15. **What is an index?**  
    - **Answer**: An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table.

16. **What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?**  
    - **Answer**: `UNION` removes duplicates, while `UNION ALL` includes duplicates.

17. **What is a stored procedure?**  
    - **Answer**: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit.

18. **What is the difference between `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`?**  
    - **Answer**: `GROUP BY` groups rows with the same values, while `ORDER BY` sorts the result set.

19. **What is a transaction in SQL?**  
    - **Answer**: A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work, ensuring data integrity.

20. **What is the difference between `COUNT(*)` and `COUNT(column_name)`?**  
    - **Answer**: `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, while `COUNT(column_name)` counts non-NULL values in the specified column.
