# SQL Study Guide

Here are a few **sample SQL queries** and **quick-reference tables** that can be added to the study guide. These will be helpful for quick lookup during the interview and can be printed for easy reference.

---


### 1. Basic SELECT Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
- Retrieves all columns and rows from the `employees` table.

---

### 2. Filtering with WHERE
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```
- Retrieves employees with a salary greater than 50,000.

---

### 3. Sorting with ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY last_name ASC;
```
- Retrieves all employees sorted by `last_name` in ascending order.

---

### 4. Grouping with GROUP BY
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```
- Groups employees by department and counts the number of employees in each department.

---

### 5. Filtering Groups with HAVING
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000;
```
- Retrieves departments with an average salary greater than 70,000.

---

### 6. Joining Tables with INNER JOIN
```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```
- Retrieves employee names and their department names by joining `employees` and `departments` tables.

---

### 7. Using Subqueries
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```
- Retrieves names of employees who work in the 'Sales' department.

---

### 8. Using UNION
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM contractors;
```
- Combines names from `employees` and `contractors` tables, removing duplicates.

---

### 9. Creating a View
```sql
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000;
```
- Creates a view that stores employees with a salary greater than 100,000.

---

### 10. Using Transactions
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```
- Transfers 100 units from account 1 to account 2 as a single transaction.

## Quick-Reference Tables

### SQL Clauses and Their Uses
